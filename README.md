community-ansible
=================

Quick Ansible role to deploy Community Ansible from PPAs on Debian/Ubuntu (will add yum/dnf later if needed).

Requirements
------------

Needs Ansible. And Ubuntu or Debian.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
